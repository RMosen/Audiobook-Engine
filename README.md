# Audiobook-Engine-Alpha

Kia Ora,

Audiobook Engine (working name) is an in-development audiobook player for android.
The eventual feature set of the software will be the ability to process the audio in real time in a way that will reduce background noise/hiss, mouth noise, and other undesirable
sounds/frequencies in audiobooks.

Audiobook Engine is programmed using [Juce](https://juce.com/).

The project is still in extremely early stages, but the plan is to have a usable beta ready by the end of October 2021.
